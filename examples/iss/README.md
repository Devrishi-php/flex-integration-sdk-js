# Universal example - Use the SDK in browser and server to fetch the current ISS space station location

This example demos the universal use of the SDK. The demo fetches the current location of ISS space station and renders it on server (see the source code). In the browser, it uses the SDK to refresh the ISS location every 5 seconds.

## Start the server

Install dependencies:

```
yarn install
```

Start the server:

```
node index.js
```

Open [http://localhost:3344](http://localhost:3344) in your browser.
